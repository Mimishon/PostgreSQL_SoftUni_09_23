        /* Exercises: PostgreSQL Table Relations
This document defines the exercise assignments for the PostgreSQL course @ Software University.
Submit your solutions in the SoftUni Judge Contest.
For the upcoming assignments, let us direct our attention toward the implementation of PRIMARY KEY.
    1. PRIMARY KEY
a. Create a table
Create a new table called "products" that includes a column named "product_name" which has a maximum character limit of 100.
Insert the following values into the "products" table: 'Broccoli', 'Shampoo', 'Toothpaste', and 'Candy'.
b. Define the primary key when changing the existing table structure
The newly created table does not have a unique identifier. To add a PRIMARY KEY, use the ALTER TABLE statement. */

CREATE TABLE products(
	product_name VARCHAR(100));
					 
INSERT INTO products 
VALUES('Broccoli'), ('Shampoo'), ('Toothpaste'), ('Candy');

ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY;

    /* 2. Remove Primary Key
Write an SQL statement to DROP CONSTRAINT from the "products" table.
*** Note, if a name is not specified explicitly for the primary key constraint, PostgreSQL will assign a default name to it. The default name for the primary 
key constraint is "table-name_pkey". */

ALTER TABLE products
DROP CONSTRAINT products_pkey;

    /* • In preparation for the upcoming task, we will adopt the subsequent naming standard for our foreign keys:
fk_<referencing_table>_<referenced_table>

       Here's the breakdown of each element:
    • "fk": serves as an indicator that the constraint relates to a foreign key
    • "<referencing_table>": represents the table containing the column designated as the foreign key
    • "<referenced_table>": signifies the table to which the foreign key refers 

Let's redirect our attention to the One-To-One Relationship for the tasks ahead.

    3. Customs
To fulfill this assignment, you are required to establish a new database named "customs_db" and produce two tables inside it, named "passports" and "people".
a. Create and Insert Passports Table
Wright a SQL statement to create a new table called "passports" with two columns, "id" and "nationality". The "id" column should be an automatically incremented primary key,
 starting at 100 and incrementing by 1. The "nationality" column should have a maximum character limit of 50.
Then, insert three rows into the "passports" table with values 'N34FG21B', 'K65LO4R7', and 'ZE657QP2' for the "nationality" column.
*** Note, when using the GENERATED AS IDENTITY constraint, a SEQUENCE object is utilized, which allows for the specification of sequence options for system-generated values. 
The following syntax can be used to specify these options: (START WITH start_from_number INCREMENT BY increment_value).
b. Create and Insert People Table
In the next step of this task, your objective is to create a new table called "people" which includes the following columns:
    • "id" column that is an automatically incremented SERIAL PRIMARY KEY;
    • "first_name" column with a maximum length of 50 characters and is of type VARCHAR;
    • "salary" column which is specified to the second decimal place and has a maximum of 10 digits;
    • "passport_id" column of type INT which is established as a FOREIGN KEY constraint and refers to the "id" column of the "passports" table (the name of a foreign 
    key constraint is "fk_people_passports").
After creating the "people" table, you need to insert three rows into it, each row should have values for the "first_name", "salary", and "passport_id" columns:
    • ('Roberto', 43300.0000, 101)
    • ('Tom', 56100.0000, 102)
    • ('Yana', 60200.0000, 100) */

CREATE TABLE passports(
	id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START WITH 100 INCREMENT BY 1) UNIQUE,
	nationality VARCHAR(50));

INSERT INTO passports (nationality)
VALUES('N34FG21B'), ('K65LO4R7'), ('ZE657QP2');

CREATE TABLE people(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	"first_name" VARCHAR(50),
    "salary" NUMERIC(10,2),
    "passport_id" INT,
	CONSTRAINT fk_people_passports
		FOREIGN KEY (passport_id)
			REFERENCES passports(id));

INSERT INTO people ("first_name", "salary", "passport_id")
VALUES('Roberto', 43300.0000, 101), 
	('Tom', 56100.0000, 102), 
	('Yana', 60200.0000, 100)
	RETURNING * ;

/* It is time to focus our attention on the One-To-Many/Many-To-One Relationship for the upcoming assignments.

4. Car Manufacture 
To complete this task, you will need to create a database called "car_manufacture_db" that consists of three tables: "manufacturers", "models", and "production_years".
a. Create Tables
The "manufacturers" table should have a column, which is "name". In the "models" table, you should include columns for "model_name" and "manufacturer_id". 
The "production_years" table should contain information about "established_on" and "manufacturer_id". You are free to select the data type for each column,
 but it is crucial to ensure that each column has a unique identifier. Additionally, it is important to correctly set up the foreign keys. Note that 
 the "models" identifier should start at 1000 and increment by 1. */


CREATE TABLE manufacturers(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	"name" VARCHAR(50));

CREATE TABLE models(
	id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1000 INCREMENT BY 1) UNIQUE,
	"model_name" VARCHAR(50),
    "manufacturer_id" INT,
	CONSTRAINT fk_models_manufacturers
		FOREIGN KEY (manufacturer_id)
			REFERENCES manufacturers("id"));
			
CREATE TABLE production_years(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	established_on DATE,
    "manufacturer_id" INT,
	CONSTRAINT fk_production_years_manufacturers
		FOREIGN KEY (manufacturer_id)
			REFERENCES manufacturers("id"));

INSERT INTO manufacturers("name") 
VALUES('BMW'), ('Tesla'), ('Lada');

INSERT INTO models("model_name", manufacturer_id) 
VALUES('X1', 1), ('i6', 1), ('Model S', 2), ('Model X', 2), ('Model 3', 2), ('Nova', 3);

INSERT INTO production_years(established_on, manufacturer_id) 
VALUES('1916-03-01', 1), ('2003-01-01', 2), ('1966-05-01', 3);

/* 6. Photo Shooting
To finish this assignment, you need to create a database called "photo_shooting_db" that comprises two tables: "customers" and "photos".
The "customers" table should contain two columns - "name" and "date". In the "photos" table, you should include columns for "url" and "place". 
The data type for each column can be chosen according to your preference, but it is essential to ensure that each column has a unique identifier. 
Moreover, correctly setting up the foreign keys is crucial. */

/* For the upcoming tasks, let's pay more attention to FOREIGN KEY and its Cascade Operations and ensure that they are correctly implemented. We will be using a 
database that you are already familiar with, but for the purpose of these tasks, the data has been modified. Therefore, create a new database named 
table_relations_geography_db. Download the 05-Exercises-Table-Relations-geography_db.sql file from the course instance, import it into your 
database's query tab, and execute the queries provided in the file.

11. Delete Cascade
Let's proceed to establish the relationships and update the "countries" table. Locate the columns that correspond to the "continents" and "currencies" tables, 
and ensure that when a record in the parent table is deleted, corresponding records in the child table are also deleted. 
Submit your query for this task in the Judge system. */



/* 12. Update Cascade
Revise the "countries_rivers" table by ensuring that its relationship with the "rivers" and "countries" tables is properly updated. When a row in the
 parent tables is updated, ensure that matching rows in the child table are also updated. */



/* 13. SET NULL
Write SQL queries to create two new tables: "customers" and "contacts". The "customers" table should have a column for "customer_name", and the 
"contacts" table should contain columns for "contact_name", "phone", "email", and "customer_id". You can choose the data type for each column based on 
your preference, but it's important to ensure that each table has a unique identifier.
To set up the foreign keys correctly, make sure that when a record in the "customers" table is deleted, the corresponding records in the "contacts" 
table have their "customer_id" value set to NULL. Additionally, when a row in the "customers" table is updated, ensure that matching rows 
in the "contacts" table are also updated accordingly.
Insert data into the tables in the format shown below:
Finally, remove the row from the "customers" table where the value of the "id" column matches 1. */



/* 14. * Peaks in Rila
Retrieve data from the " table_relations_geography_db" database by joining the "mountains" and "peaks" tables using their common data. 
Then, display all peaks for the "Rila" mountain, including the "mountain_range", "peak_name", and "elevation". Finally, sort the results in descending order by the "elevation". */



/* 15. * Countries Without Any Rivers
Create an SQL query that retrieves data from the "table_relations_geography_db" database by joining the "countries" and "countries_rivers" tables based on their common data. 
Then, calculate the total number of countries that do not have any rivers.
 *** Note, using a LEFT JOIN will ensure that all records from the "countries" table are included in the result set, 
 and a WHERE clause will filter out rows where the "countries_rivers" table has no corresponding records. */
