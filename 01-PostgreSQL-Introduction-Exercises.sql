-- As you know, the former supervillain Gru is now the leader of the Minions. 
-- Given their large number, he needs your help to create a database to store important information for them.
--     0. Create a Database
-- You have already learned how to create a database using the pgAdmin interface. 
-- Now it's time to use a SQL query to create a new database named "minions_db".

CREATE DATABASE minions_db
    
--     1. Create a Table
-- In the newly created database, add a new table. Write SQL statement to create table "minions" 
-- including columns:
--     • "id" - should be a primary key, and automatically incremented; 
--     • "name" - with a max length of 30 characters;
--     •  "age" - should be a whole number;
-- Submit your query for the table in the Judge system.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS minions(
	"id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	"name" VARCHAR(30),
	"age" INT);

--     2. Rename the Table
-- To avoid confusion, rename the newly created table to "minions_info". 
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

ALTER TABLE minions
RENAME TO minions_info;

--     3. Alter the Table
-- As Gru builds a new weapon, he must delegate responsibilities to the Minions 
-- and give them tasks. For this reason, you need to update the table by adding new columns:
--     • "code" - represents the place where the Minion works and is exactly 4 characters long;
--     • "task" - text with no length limit;
--     • "salary" - specify to the third decimal place and has 8 digits;
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

ALTER TABLE minions_info
ADD COLUMN code CHAR(4),
ADD COLUMN task TEXT,
ADD COLUMN salary NUMERIC(8,3);

--     4. Rename Column
-- Gru does not like the name of the column "salary", so he wants to change the name of this column to "banana".
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

ALTER TABLE minions_info
RENAME COLUMN salary TO banana;

--     5. Add New Columns
-- You need to update the table again because Gru forgot to mention that he needs to store emails 
-- to send Minions their schedules for the week. He also asks for information on whether Minions 
-- have the necessary equipment. Add two new columns with the following data:
--     • "email" - with a max length of 20 characters;
--     • "equipped" - state of true or false;
-- *** Note, PostgreSQL offers three states of BOOLEAN data type: TRUE, FALSE, or NULL. Therefore, add a constraint to the BOOLEAN type.
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

ALTER TABLE minions_info
ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(20),
ADD COLUMN equipped BOOLEAN NOT NULL;

--     6. Create ENUM Type
-- An enum type is a data type whose value is chosen from an enumerated list of possibilities. 
-- This will help Gru to understand how the Minions feel. Create type "type_mood" that contains the following set of values:
--     • ('happy', 'relaxed', 'stressed', 'sad')
-- In the table add another column "mood" of type "type_mood".
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

CREATE TYPE type_mood
AS ENUM('happy', 'relaxed', 'stressed', 'sad');

ALTER TABLE minions_info 
ADD COLUMN mood "type_mood";


--     7. Set Default
-- To maintain data accuracy and reliability in the table, it is necessary to establish specific rules. 
-- By default, columns allow NULL values. To enforce the columns to disallow NULL values,
--  the following rules should be implemented:
--     • "age" - should have a DEFAULT 0;
--     • "name" and "code" - should have an empty string as the default value;
-- *** Note, in this case, you need to use ALTER COLUMN to update/edit specific columns.
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

ALTER TABLE minions_info 
ALTER COLUMN age SET DEFAULT 0,
ALTER COLUMN "name" SET DEFAULT '',
ALTER COLUMN CODE SET DEFAULT '';

--     8. Add Constraints
-- Constraints can be specified when the table is created or afterward. Please use the syntax below to add constraints to the given columns:
-- ALTER TABLE <table_name>
-- ADD CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> <constraint_definition> (<column1>, <column2>, ... <column_n>);
-- Add them to the following columns:
--     • "id" and "email"- should be UNIQUE across all the table rows. The constraint name for this column is "unique_containt";
--     • "banana" - should always be a positive number and greater than 0. The constraint name for this column is " banana_check";
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

ALTER TABLE minions_info
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_containt UNIQUE ("id", email),
-- more conventional and informative way of naming the constraint is "UQ_email_and_id"
ADD CONSTRAINT banana_check CHECK (banana > 0);

--     9. Change Column’s Data Type
-- Gru has noticed that Dr. Nefario is taking too much time to write about the daily tasks of the Minions.
--  He wants to change the data type of the "task" column and limit its length to 150 characters. 
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

ALTER TABLE minions_info 
ALTER task TYPE VARCHAR (150);

--     10. Drop Constraint
-- Gru has realized that he needs to give the Minions two days off per week and wants to update the database accordingly. 
-- To do this, you need to remove the constraint that prevents the "equipped" column from having a NULL value.
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

ALTER TABLE minions_info
ALTER COLUMN code
DROP NOT NULL;

--     11. Remove Column
-- Dr. Nefario decided to create another table and move some data there. Help him by writing a SQL query to DROP the column "age".
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

ALTER TABLE minions_info
DROP COLUMN age;

--     12. Table Birthdays
-- Assist Dr. Nefario in creating a new table to store information about the Minions' birthdays 
-- and organize surprise parties. Make sure to add constraints to the data types, the "id" must be UNIQUE, 
-- and be cautious of non-NULL and DEFAULT values. The table should be named "minions_birthdays" and include the following columns:
--     • "id";
--     • "name" - with a max length of 50 characters;
--     • "date_of_birth" - should be of type Date;
--     • "age";
--     • "present" - with a max length of 100 characters;
--     • "party" - should contain both date and time, with time zone because 
-- the guests are coming from different countries;
-- Submit your query for the table in the Judge system.


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS minions_birthdays(
	"id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	"name" VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	"date_of_birth" DATE NOT NULL,
	"age" INT,
	"present" VARCHAR(100),
	"party" TIMESTAMPTZ);

--     13. * Insert Into
-- Let's INSERT data into the "minions_info" table. The data is given in a table in the exercise file.
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

INSERT INTO minions_info
	(name, code, task, banana, email, equipped, mood)
VALUES 
	('Mark', 'GKYA', 'Graphing Points', 3265.265, 'mark@minion.com', false, 'happy'),		
	('Mel', 'HSK', 'Science Investigation', 54784.996, 'mel@minion.com', true, 'stressed'),
	('Bob', 'HF', 'Painting', 35.652, 'bob@minion.com', true, 'happy'),
	('Darwin', 'EHND', 'Create a Digital Greeting', 321.958, 'darwin@minion.com', false, 'relaxed'),
	('Kevin', 'KMHD', 'Construct with Virtual Blocks', 35214.789, 'kevin@minion.com', false, 'happy'),
	('Norbert', 'FEWB', 'Testing', 3265.500, 'norbert@minion.com', true, 'sad'),
	('Donny', 'L', 'Make a Map', 8.452, 'donny@minion.com', true, 'happy');

--     14. * Select
-- Gru has a specific requirement to fetch information from the "minions_info" table. 
-- Therefore, he has approached you to write a SQL query that can retrieve the "name", 
-- "task", "email", and "banana" columns for him.
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

SELECT "name", "task", "email", "banana"
		 FROM minions_info;

--     15. Truncate the Table
-- Kevin has shown you what he learned in the PostgreSQL course and deleted all data stored 
-- in the database. Can you utilize the query he wrote to TRUNCATE all the records in the "minions_info" table? 
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

TRUNCATE minions_info

--     16. Drop the Table
-- Gru disagrees with Dr. Nefario's idea for the parties and requests that you delete the "minions_birthdays" table.
-- Submit your query for this task in the Judge system.

DROP TABLE minions_birthdays

--     17. Drop the Database
-- As Gru's weapon is ready, you can delete the "minions_db" database because it will no longer be needed.
-- *** Note, the database can only be executed by the database owner. It cannot be executed while you are connected to the target database. 
-- You can connect to "postgres" or any other database to issue this command. Also, if anyone else is connected to the target database, 
-- this command will fail unless you use the FORCE option.

DROP DATABASE minions_db
